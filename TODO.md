# Todo
- fix: if running external command, e.g. top, and then exiting with ctrl+c, it will also exit the shell
- fix: only able to run single external command, e.g. time ls, does not work since time is command and ls is argument

# Done
<!-- - find a way to propperly do dependency injection of an associated function on a trait -->
