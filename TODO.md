# Todo
- fix: ls -la filesize is wrong on windows
- fix: ls -la alias as ll
- fix: ls should highlight directories and should not show .\ or ./ for files
- fix: cp should use -f to copy over existing file
- fix: windows cp / mv file into directory does not work
  - Access is denied. (os error 5)
- fix: if running external command, e.g. top, and then exiting with ctrl+c, it will also exit the shell
- fix: only able to run single external command, e.g. time ls, does not work since time is command and ls is argument
